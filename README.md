# Mesto (back-end)

This application is a pet-project developed within the Practicum web-development course. It enables users to perform CRUD operations on image cards, including creation, deletion, and viewing, as well as liking them.

The backend of the application is built using Express.js for the server and MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose.js providing the connection between them. The following features have been implemented:

- A simple server capable of handling CRUD requests.
- Schemas and models for two entities, users and cards.
- Routes for processing user and card requests.
- User authentication for secure access to routes with content.
- Data validation using the Joi and Celebrate libraries and at the schema level.
